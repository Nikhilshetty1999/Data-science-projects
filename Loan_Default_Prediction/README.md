Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions to minimize losses and optimize lending processes.

This project leverages historical loan data to build a neural network that predicts default risk, enabling banks to:

Reduce financial losses by identifying high-risk applicants

Optimize approval processes through automated risk assessment

Maintain regulatory compliance with data-driven decisions

Improve customer satisfaction through fair lending practices
