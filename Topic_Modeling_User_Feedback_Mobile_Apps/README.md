“Project on topic modeling of user feedback from 15 leading mobile apps.”
When you look at the reviews for popular mobile apps, it’s like being in a crowded room where everyone’s talking at once—some are happy, some are frustrated, and most just want to be heard. For app companies, making sense of thousands of reviews is a real challenge. That’s where this project comes in.

I built a system that automatically picks out the main themes from user feedback, so product teams can focus on what really matters—fixing bugs, adding features, or smoothing out payment issues. By using topic modeling on reviews from 15 top mobile apps, we get a clear picture of what users care about most. This isn’t just about making sense of feedback; it’s about making apps better and keeping users happy.
